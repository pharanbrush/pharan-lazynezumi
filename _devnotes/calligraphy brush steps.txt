// This script makes the brush shape tilt slightly toward the direction the line is going.
// Set the brush to respond to pen tilt angle so we can manipulate it using that.
// The angle tilt is more subtle when pressing down normally, and tilts fully when the pressure is light.
// This tilt behavior 


//Line Angle
//Get the angle based on the line direction
//Offset this angle with a user-custom angle
//This is the angle the brush tip wants to go based on its movement.

// Angle Smoothing
// Store the current angle and make it move towards the target angle every frame
// to prevent artifacts when the brush turns.
