Some customization and scripts I made for Lazy Nezumi Pro (LNP)


# Scripts
## How to install scripts in LNP
As of **Lazy Nezumi Pro Version 22.10.05.2045**:

Each script is an `.xml` file.
The name of the script you select in the LNP interface comes from the filename.

Copy the scripts (.xml files) and paste it into the folder named `distortion` inside the LNP install folder.

By default, this is `C:\Program Files (x86)\Lazy Nezumi Pro\distortion\` .

There are already subfolders inside the `distortion` folder for each category. Make your own subfolder. The name will be used as the heading in the script list.


## Pharan's LNP Scripts
### dotted line
![](docimg/scripts-dotted-line.gif)  
Use **dotted line** to make dotted lines.  
> This requires your brush to respond to pen pressure. If the brush still draws at near-zero pressure, lines will be drawn in the gaps accordingly.  
> LNP or your drawing program may apply some pressure smoothing so drawing too quickly may yield incorrect results.


### wobble - jagged
![](docimg/scripts-wobble-jagged.gif)  
Use **wobble** to mimic drawing on an uneven surface.

### unstraighten - slight wobble
![](docimg/scripts-unstraighten-slightwobble.gif)  
Use **unstraighten** to add a slight wobble to lines and shapes.
