Some customization and scripts I made for Lazy Nezumi Pro (LNP)


# Icon Set
## How to install an icon set to LNP
As of **Lazy Nezumi Pro Version 22.10.05.2045**:

Each icon set is a folder containing png files for each icon.

Copy the folder containing the icon pngs into the folder named `icons` inside the LNP install folder.

By default, this is `C:\Program Files (x86)\Lazy Nezumi Pro\icons\` .

In the main window of Lazy Nezumi Pro, choose `Settings > Toolbar Settings > Edit toolbar.xml`. This will open the settings file in your text editor. 

Change the value inside the `<iconfolder>` tag to the folder you want.

For example: `<iconfolder>icons/yournewiconpackfolder</iconfolder>` .

Save the file. You may need to close and open LNP again for it to fully take effect.

It looks like this.  


# Scripts
## How to install scripts in LNP
As of **Lazy Nezumi Pro Version 22.10.05.2045**:

Each script is an `.xml` file.
The name of the script you select in the LNP interface comes from the filename.

Copy the scripts (.xml files) and paste it into the folder named `distortion` inside the LNP install folder.

By default, this is `C:\Program Files (x86)\Lazy Nezumi Pro\distortion\` .

There are already subfolders inside the `distortion` folder for each category. Make your own subfolder. The name will be used as the heading in the script list.


## Pharan's LNP Scripts
### dotted line
![](docimg/scripts-dotted-line.gif)  
Use **dotted line** to make dotted lines.  
> This requires your brush to respond to pen pressure. If the brush still draws at near-zero pressure, lines will be drawn in the gaps accordingly.  
> LNP or your drawing program may apply some pressure smoothing so drawing too quickly may yield incorrect results.


### unstraighten - slight wobble
![](docimg/scripts-unstraighten-slightwobble.gif)  
Use **unstraighten** to add a slight wobble to lines and shapes.


### unstraighten - rocky surface
![](docimg/scripts-wobble-jagged.gif)  
Also try **rocky surface** for a more jagged look.


### pressure - pressure multiplier
![](docimg/scripts-pressure-pressuremultiplier.gif)  
If your pen pressure settings don't agree with the calibration of a certain brush for what you need it to do, use **pressure multiplier** to temporarily harden or soften your pressure.  


### pressure - wobble

Use this script to achieve a loose-ink/melty-crayon/Flash brush look. The "size" parameter gives you more flexibility vs the noise provided by most painting software.
